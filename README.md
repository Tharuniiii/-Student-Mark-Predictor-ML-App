# -Student-Mark-Predictor-ML-App
This project is a simple Machine Learning web application built using Flask. The app predicts the marks a student can achieve based on the number of study hours they input. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of training a regression model, saving it, and deploying it into a web application with an interactive UI.
